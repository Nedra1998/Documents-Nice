# [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)

> Dark theme for ...

Dracula is one of the largest color schemes, it has been ported to hundreds of
programs, and almost any program has a port for hit. This means that it is
possible to configure all applications to use the same scheme, without much
issue. However, there is not a precise guide on the usage of the colors, so
different ports may not match exactly.

Personally I find that the theme is too leaned towards purple and green colors.
I appreciate the vast number of applications that have this theme, but
aesthetically I find it not for me. I also think that the colors, especially the
green could be too vibrant, and can be distracting.
