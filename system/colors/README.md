# Colors

There are thousands of different color schemes, and each one has different
focuses and aesthetics. This section demonstrates a set of color schemes that I
commonly use, and would suggest. Specifically I compare the different colors
schemes aesthetics, readability, and the number of applications which it is
supported for.

Currently I am using [Ayu-Mirage](Ayu).
