->This is a collection of my personal notes, and comments on a number of
different systems and resources. It is mealy to be used as a reference tool for
many tools that I commonly use, and some alternatives to those tools. All of
these resources walk you through how to setup and start using the different
tools. In addition to the tools, I also use this as references for any number of
topics. Including my notes on different subjects, and my thoughts and work.<-
