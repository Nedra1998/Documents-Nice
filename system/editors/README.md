# Editors

My comments on different text editors. Specifically how to set them up, and what
their respective pros and cons are for each one. This is highly opinionated, but
I try to note my reasons whenever possible. I also include details on their
configuration that I use for them, such as which plugins and color schemes.

For new users, I recommend using [VSCode](VSCode). It provides great functionality, and
has a very large user base for answering any questions. For users who prefer a
terminal based editor, I would recommend [Neovim](Neovim). It is highly
extensible, but does not impose anything on the user. I find that although it
takes much more work to learn, it has unrivaled efficiency and customizability.

However, customizing a Neovim configuration can take lots of time, and I would
recommend against using someone else's configuration, as that imposes their
work flow on your unrelated work. If creating your own configuration is too
much, I would recommend considering SpaceVim. It is built off of Vim, and
provides a lot of very useful features out of the box.
